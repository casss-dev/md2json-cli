The farm is by far the most important and overlooked area of the coffee industry by consumers. Each farm is responsible for a large portion of the final taste. The coffee cherries need to be raised, picked, processed, and stored carefully, or the beans will never live up to their full potential. High quality Arabica beans are most often hand picked and the process is extremely labor intensive for a very small payload in weight. Finer Arabica coffees are also coincidentally much more difficult to grow as they require more maintenance and are less resistent to disease. After the beans are picked, they are carefully processed and dried using a variety of methods anywhere between removing the pulp completely or leaving it on. Finally after processing, beans are meticulously sorted and graded depending on their color, size, fermentation, and damage. With all of these steps in place, any combination of factors can make the same coffee taste like many coffees."

      "content": "Since the pandemic began, coffee farms have faced significant hardships. They've had labor shortages due to social distancing and increased overhead due to lower demand from green coffee buyers. Transportation of goods has also been an issue. With less coffee being purchased and consumed, producers face decreased market value for a crop they work all year to produce. The decrease in demand leads to a lower market value, which eventually trickles down to affect the already marginalized coffee picker's wages. In short, coffee farms need roasters and coffee shops to buy more coffee."

It can be many things for many different people. A place to work, a place to socialize, or even just a place to be alone. Everyone has their beverage of choice. Walking into a shop, you may see a variety of people and a variety of beverages. Espresso, cortados, lattes, cappuccinos, iced, hot, sweet, or not. When you factor in all of these personal choices for being at a simple coffee shop, you might start to see how our identities can be exemplified by the shops we choose to visit everyday. This is part of what makes coffee so unique and exciting."

      "content": "This pandemic has brought an unexpected wave of changes for many shops around the world. Establishments have had to close or halt most of their business operations since the pandemic started. Some even chose to stay open to keep their employees afloat. In order to survive the wave, new business practices and offerings were made. Takeaway coffee has allowed shops to stay open without sacrificing the loss of staff. Most companies are encouraged to adopt a stronger online presence as most customers are moving their shopping to the web. Besides selling coffee and merchandise, many store front owners have improved their online presence by publishing meaningful social media content. With most coffee being consumed at home, customers are now looking for unique brewing tutorials to help them make better cups. Fortunately with the internet, being in the coffee business is still do-able. If you used to visit shops but have stopped since, checkout out your local shop's website. Most coffee shops have online subscription-based models that are very convenient. Virtual tip jars have also become a new way to support your local baristas."

Even with all that's been happening, it's still an exciting time to be into coffee. The amount of coffee made at home has greatly increased since the pandemic began. In a way, we've all become our own barista. This is exciting because coffee is a science. As with all sciences, the more scientists we have in an industry, the quicker that industry can grow and expand its knowledge. Many coffee connoisseurs are experimenting with new brewing methods and techniques. There are more brewing devices out than ever before, each giving a new subtle twist on the taste of coffee. If you're just starting out, our recommendation is to invest in a good grinder, it makes all the difference. If you're going to be brewing coffee at home at least for a while, make sure you support your local caf√©s! Buying fresh roasted coffee or merch from them specifically really helps during this time."
